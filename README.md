# BACKEND CODE TO FINAL PROJECT
This project is the backend code to my nursing (Sk√∂trum) app I did for my final project at Technigo.

# TECHNOLOGIES
I used NodeJs and Express together with mongoose to create mongoose models and RESTful endpoint. I created a GET endpoint to get the data from my mongoose models. And a POST endpoint to be able to post comments.

I created the data myself in excel and the I used https://www.csvjson.com/ to vonert the data to json.
